## TrussSense â€” Presence Lighting Infrastructure

### Abstract
This project provides an open, reproducible LED infrastructure for telepresence on an OptiTrack truss. WS2813 strips are mounted to the truss and driven from a Raspberry Pi via a FastAPI service exposing programmable effects and direct color control. The system integrates with Home Assistant and supports nonâ€‘invasive human monitoring (e.g., heart rate via Playwright) to map realâ€‘time biosignals to ambient light displays that communicate mood and presence. The emphasis is infrastructure: clear APIs, modular effects, and endâ€‘toâ€‘end setup so anyone can reâ€‘create the installation from scratch.

FastAPI service to control WS2813 (WS281xâ€‘compatible) LED strips mounted on a truss. Provides REST endpoints for direct color control and several animated visual effects, including integrations for Home Assistant and a heartâ€‘rate visualization.

### Features
- Direct control: clear, set color, set brightness, color by range
- Effects: bitcoin, glow, wave, color wipe, color fade, sparkle, rainbow, rainbow cycle, theater chase, running, heartâ€‘rate
- Heartâ€‘rate visualization using Playwright (Chromium headless)
- Home Assistant Lovelace controls and automations

### Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi 4B** with PWM-capable GPIO pins (Pi 5 not supported)
- **WS2813 LED strips** (30m total: 2x 15m sections, ~60 LEDs/meter)
- **6x 5V/20A DC Power Supply Units** (one every 5m for power injection)
- **Common ground** between LED power supply and Raspberry Pi

**Wiring Configuration:**
- **Strip 1 (15m)**: 896 LEDs on GPIO18 (Pin 12), 3x 5m segments with power injection
- **Strip 2 (15m)**: 894 LEDs on GPIO13 (Pin 33), 3x 5m segments with power injection
- **Total**: 1790 LEDs (~60 LEDs/meter Ã— 30 meters)
- **Note**: Some LEDs were removed due to damage/burnout, reducing count from theoretical 1800
- **Power**: 6x 5V/20A PSUs connected in parallel, one between each 5m segment
- **Ground**: Connect all LED GND to Pi GND (common ground reference)
- **Data**: Connect LED data-in (DI) and backup data-in (BI) to respective GPIO pins

**Wiring Diagram**:

> **ðŸ“‹ Hardware Setup**: The wiring diagram above shows the complete circuit layout including power injection points, GPIO connections, and proper grounding. Follow this diagram exactly for optimal performance.

**Safety Notes:**
- Each LED can draw up to ~60mA at full white (total ~108A for 1800 LEDs)
- Power injection every 5m prevents voltage drop on long runs
- Never power LED strips from Pi 5V pin
- Use proper fusing and circuit protection
- LED density: 60 LEDs per meter (standard WS2813 strip)

### Software Prerequisites (on Raspberry Pi)
- **Raspberry Pi 4B or earlier** (Pi 5 not supported due to `rpi-ws281x` library limitations)
- **Python 3.9+**
- **System packages**: `libatlas-base-dev` (for numpy performance), chromium dependencies for Playwright
- **Python packages**: See `requirements.txt` for exact versions
- **Optional but recommended**: Python virtual environment

---

### Installation
```bash

# Clone repository
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/IERoboticsAILab/led_truss.git
cd led_truss

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browser (required for heart-rate effect)
python -m playwright install chromium
```

**Note**: If you don't need the heart-rate effect, you can skip the Playwright installation.

---

### Configuration
The default configuration matches the wiring diagram:
- **Strip 1**: 896 LEDs on GPIO18 (Pin 12) - 15m section (~60 LEDs/meter)
- **Strip 2**: 894 LEDs on GPIO13 (Pin 33) - 15m section (~60 LEDs/meter)
- **Total**: 1790 LEDs across 30m of WS2813 strips (reduced from 1800 due to damaged LEDs)

To modify the configuration, edit `app/core/truss.py`:
```python
def __init__(self, strip1_count=896, strip2_count=894, strip1_pin=18, strip2_pin=13, freq=800000, dma=10, brightness=125):
```

**Parameters:**
- `strip1_count` / `strip2_count`: Number of LEDs per strip
- `strip1_pin` / `strip2_pin`: GPIO pins for data lines
- `brightness`: Initial brightness (0-255)

---

### Running the API
```bash
cd ~/led_truss
source venv/bin/activate
sudo python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Important Notes:**
- `sudo` is required for `rpi_ws281x` to access PWM hardware

### Systemd Service (Optional)
For production deployment, create a systemd service:

```bash
# Copy the provided service file
sudo cp led_truss.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Reload and enable the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now led-truss
```

The service file is included in the repository and configured for the default installation path.

---

### Quick start (curl)
```bash
# Set all LEDs to white
curl -X POST http://<pi-ip>:8000/control/set-color

# Rainbow cycle (runs continuously until stopped)
curl -X POST http://<pi-ip>:8000/effects/rainbow-cycle -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"wait_ms":50}'

# Clear
curl -X POST http://<pi-ip>:8000/control/clear
```

See the API quick reference below.

### API overview
- Root: `GET /` â†’ welcome message
- Effects map: `GET /effects` â†’ returns metadata from `effects_map.json`
- Direct control endpoints are under `/control/*`
- Effects endpoints are under `/effects/*`

See the API quick reference below.

### Home Assistant integration
This repository includes example YAML under `home_assistant_config/`:
- `rest_commands.yaml` builds the correct endpoint URL and payloads
- `input_numbers.yaml`, `input_booleans.yaml`, `input_selects.yaml`, `input_texts.yaml` provide UI helpers
- `lights.yaml` defines a color picker helper light
- `automations.yaml` keeps the helper light and RGB inputs in sync
- `lovelace_led_control.yaml` is a dashboard layout for controls

**Prerequisites:**
- Install `custom:light-entity-card` from HACS for the RGB color picker functionality

**Setup Steps:**
1. Copy the YAML contents into your Home Assistant configuration (adjust IPs).
2. Ensure the REST command URL points to your Pi IP.
3. Reload YAML / restart, then add the Lovelace dashboard JSON as a view.

**Heart Rate Integration**: The heart-rate effect works by scraping [HypeRate.io](https://www.hyperate.io) URLs that display real-time heart rate data. The default URL in the Home Assistant config is `https://app.hyperate.io/15875` - replace this with your personal HypeRate session URL. The effect looks for elements with the `.heartrate` class and maps heart rate values to colors (greenâ†’yellowâ†’red).
